		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>I ran/helped run Square's Capture-The-Flag events from 2015-2019.
			Moving forward, I'm happy to have found a group of very talented engineers
			at Square to host our future events. This document contains my notes for
			anyone interested to host their own internal or external events.</p>

		<h1>What is a Capture-The-Flag?</h1>
		<p>A Capture-The-Flag (CTF) is a computer security competition where
			participants practice their security attack and defense skills to solve
			challenges to gain points.</p>
		<p>One of the motivations for running a CTF is to try and make security and
			hacking more approachable.
		</p>
		<p>Organizing such events usually takes 4-5 volunteers, a small amount
			of money, and a ton of time.</p>

		<h1>My Typical Timeline</h1>

		<p><b>12 months prior</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Get approval from management. Usually the main issue is budget and we
			typically request $1,000-$2,000 (pro-tip: request 2x what you think you'll need).</li>
		<li>List event on <a href="https://ctftime.org/calendar/">CTFtime</a>. It's the main calendar everyone uses to find
			out about CTFs.</li>

		<p></p>
		<p><b>4 months prior</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Reach out to co-workers for volunteers. In the past, some people
			incorrectly felt they couldn't volunteer without some prior specific
			security knowledge. Make it clear that anyone can help out!
			<br/></br>
			We usually look for: 1 person for story writing, 2 people
			for making puzzles, 2 or more people for testing puzzles, and 1 person for
			prizes.
			<br/></br>
			If I can't find a volunteer for a given role, I end up doing it
			myself.</li>
		<li>Start discussing puzzle ideas, how easy or hard we want to make each
			one, etc. This is one of the hardest part of the entire process. Lots of
		  interesting ideas end up unsuitable for puzzles. Real world security
			issues are great sources of inspiration.</li>
		<li>The following tips are useful when making puzzles:
		<p><ul>
			<li>Try to make puzzles which are educational. Unless your puzzle boils
				down to a sudoku or a maze, it is probably going to inherently require
				learning or applying some knowledge.</li>
			<li>A puzzle which requires some thinking / can be solved without sitting
				in front of a computer the whole time is great.</li>
			<li>A bit of mystery / not making the next step too obvious is nice. The
				risk is having a puzzle which requires some guess work, which can be
				frustrating. One option is to make puzzles with one obvious but hard
				solution and another less obvious but easier. Overall, a hard balance to
				strike.</li>
			<li>Each puzzle should have one or more flags. Ensure the flag fits the
				agreed upon format. Make sure each possible solution maps to a flag.</li>
			<li>Puzzles can run client side or server side. For server side puzzles,
				make it run inside Docker. In the past, we tried to give each team a
				container but orchestration became challenging. As a result, we make
				containers immutable and shared (e.g. if your puzzle requires exploiting
				a SQLi, make sure the flag can't be deleted once found).</li>
			<li>Once your puzzle is ready, have one or more people test it (to ensure
				it is solvable). Ask the person testing your puzzle to track roughly how
				long it took to solve. If you tweak anything based on feedback from
				people testing your puzzle, make sure you get someone to retest the
				modified puzzle.</li>
		</ul></p></li>

		<li>As a tradition, we have had a puzzle which requires programming or
			understanding obscure/unexpected languages. In 2017, I made a
			<a href="2017/ciphercel.html">Google Sheet</a> puzzle. In 2018, it was
			<a href="2018/postfuscator.html">PostScript</a>. In 2019, it was a
			<a href="2019/makefile.html">Makefile</a>. The
			purpose of these esoteric puzzles is to level the playing field since it's
			unlikely for people to have a knowledge or tooling edge.</li>

		<li>The following list is used to classify puzzles into categories. We try
			to ensure we have a variety of puzzles:
		<p><ul>
			<li>Pure coding. Solving requires writing some code and doing little of
				anything else. E.g. given an encoder, write the decoder (or
				vice-versa).</li>
			<li>Crackme. Given a piece of code, find the input which displays the flag.
				Requires understanding what the code is doing without having to find an
				exploit. Derive the flag from the input/partially from the
				input (be careful about having multiple solutions) so that you can’t
				simply modify branches in the code.</li>
			<li>Exploit: typically stack, buffer overflow. Similar to crackme, but
				requires going one step further.</li>
			<li>Web security: typically SQLi or manipulating cookies. Or other
				web-specific things.</li>
			<li>Cryptography: homemade crypto gone wrong. Or known weaknesses.</li>
		</ul></p>
		</li>

		<p></p>
		<p><b>2 weeks prior</b></p>
		<p>Test, test, test. Our infrastructure (and costs) boils down to:
			<li>Github pages for static pages ($0).</li>
			<li>Slack for discussion / coordination ($0).</li>
			<li>Cloudflare for caching ($0).</li>
			<li>Custom piece of Go code running on Heroku (~$100). The code is similar
			to <a href="https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd">CTFd</a> but tries to achieve a
			much higher cache hit-rate.</li>
			<li>Amazon AWS ECS for running containers (~$100).</li>
		</p>

		<p>My main concern is to <b>keep our servers up</b> while <b>minimizing</b> costs.
			Every year, we bring the infrastructure up for a couple days and then
			everything off. Since we are dealing with ephemeral systems and devops isn't
			our forte, we make mistakes and run into surprising issues&nbsp;¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

		<p>Start <span style="text-decoration: line-through">spamming</span> posting
			on social media. One year, we did three
			<a href="https://twitter.com/SquareCTF/status/1170060840550031360">warm</a>
			<a href="https://twitter.com/squareeng/status/1172567307593248769">up</a>
			<a href="https://twitter.com/alokmenghrajani/status/1179658544129273856">puzzles</a>,
			which was fun.
		</p>

		<p></p>
		<p><b>post-event</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Turn infrastructure off.</li>
			<li>Use the remaining budget (usually ~$800) to buy (or craft) prizes and mail them.</li>
			<li>Archive puzzles on this site (yes, you can go back and play every previous puzzle!).</li>
			<li>Hold a post-mortem session with all volunteers to document what went
				well and what can be improved in subsequent years.</li>
		</ul>

		<p align="center">* * * </p>
		<p></p>
		<p>That's it. I would like to thank everyone who helped out along the way as
			well as everyone who participated in our events! I hope you'll find this
			information useful. Keep in mind that the first year is the most work,
			subsequent events require less work and run smoother.</p>
