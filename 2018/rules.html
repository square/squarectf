		<h1>Name</h1>
		<p>contest-rules  -  2018 Square Capture  the  Flag rules.</p>

		<h2>Dates</h2>
		<p>The event starts on November 8th 2018, at 19:00 UTC and ends on November 14th 2018, at 19:00 UTC.</p>
		<p>All puzzles will be available for future download. Points will not be awarded for solving them after the event ends.</p>

    <h2>Flag format</h2>
    <p>You know you have successfully solved a puzzle if you find a string which matches the following
      <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png">regular expression</a>: <span>/flag-[0-9a-f]{8,32}/i</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
      For instance, <span class="inv">flag-27fbe50bf1ccdaf5cfc9a1</span> or <span class="inv">FLAG-E8EFDA46</span> would be valid flags.
    </p>

    <h2>Timed release</h2>
    <p>
      Each puzzle will be released at a specific time (spread over one week). Participants are able to see when
      each puzzle gets released.
    </p>

    <h2>Time-decay points</h2>
    <p>
      The first team to solve a challenge will be awarded 10000 points. Subsequent teams to correctly solve the challenge
      get fewer points, the exact number is based on the following time-decay function:
		</p>
		<div class="prewrapper">
			<pre>
      |              s   |
      |            ----- |
      |            60000 |
      |          1       |
pts = | 10000 * ---      |
      |_         2      _|
			</pre>
		</div>

    <h2>Prizes</h2>
    <p>
      Prizes will be awarded to the top scoring team. The organizers will contact the winning team to organize prize
      delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is a tie, the first team to have scored their last point, based on the organizers' records, wins the
      tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decision of the organizers will be final and binding with regard to the prizes.
    </p>

		<h2>Teams</h2>
		<p>
			One-person teams are allowed, but it's more fun with friends! There is no limit on team size.
