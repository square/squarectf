		<h1>Name</h1>
		<p>contest-rules - 2019 Square Capture the Flag rules.</p>

		<h2>Dates</h2>
		<p>The event starts on October 10th 2019, at 19:00 UTC and ends on October 16th 2019, at 19:00 UTC.</p>
		<p>Puzzles will be available for future download. Points will not be awarded for solving them after the event ends.</p>
		<p>All puzzles are solvable <b>without brute forcing</b> the solutions.</p>

    <h2>Flag format</h2>
    <p>You know you have successfully solved a puzzle if you find a string which matches the following
      <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png">regular expression</a>:<br/>
			<span>/flag-[0-9a-f]{8,64}/i</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
      For instance, <span class="inv">flag-27fbe50bf1ccdaf5cfc9a1</span> or <span class="inv">FLAG-E8EFDA46</span> would be valid flags.
    </p>

    <h2>Timed release</h2>
    <p>
      Each puzzle will be released at a specific time (spread over one week). Schedule is made available before the
      event start. The release times are carefully picked to avoid favoring any given timezone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puzzles are independent and can be solved in any order.
    </p>

    <h2>First solver bonus</h2>
    <p>
      The first team to solve a challenge and submit a valid flag will be awarded bonus points.
		</p>

		<h2>Reference machine</h2>
		<p>
			All puzzles have been verified to be solvable using Ubuntu 18.04 and Chrome 77.0.3865.90. Most puzzles should be
			solvable on a variety of operating system / browser / virtualization software combinations.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a puzzle contains binaries for various platforms, only the Linux binary is guaranteed to be correct. Other
			platforms are provided as a convenience only and are not guaranteed to work.
		</p>

    <h2>Prizes</h2>
    <p>
      Small prizes will be awarded to the top scoring team or teams. The organizers will contact the winners to organize
			prize delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is a tie, the first team to have scored their last point, based on the organizers' records, wins the
      tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decision of the organizers will be final and binding with regard to the prizes.
    </p>

		<h2>Teams</h2>
		<p>
			One-person teams are allowed, but it's more fun with friends! There is no limit on team size. We try our best to
			provide prizes for all team members, without guarantee for teams larger than ten (10) members.
		</p>

		<h1><b>Terms of Service</b></h1><br/>
		<h2>Email and data use</h2>
