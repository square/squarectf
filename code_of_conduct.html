    <h1>Name</h1>
    <p>
      code-of-coduct  -   We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all participants, organizers, and
      other members of the community (collectively known as Users) of the Block Capture The Flag ("CTF") Competition,
      and its presence on the corresponding BlockCTF Discord free from discrimination for any reason
      including on the basis of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, age and
      religion. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for User behavior as well as the steps to reporting and
      consequences for unacceptable behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
    <p>All Users are expected to:
      <ul>
        <li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
        <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior or speech.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow Users – your fellow Users may have a different level of
          comfort with respect to language and personal space.</li>
        <li>Alert Block CTF organizers (see Reporting Guide below) if you notice any unacceptable behavior.</li>
      </ul>
		</p>
    <p>This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative,
      shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
    </p>

    <h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
    <p>
      Unacceptable behaviors include:
      <ul>
        <li>Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning conduct.</li>
        <li>Offensive verbal comments including as related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
          disability, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.</li>
        <li>Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public and online spaces (including but not limited to
          public channels, private groups, and direct messages in the BlockCTF Discord).</li>
        <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following of other Users.</li>
        <li>Harassing photography, recording or conversation.</li>
        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
    <p>
      Unacceptable behavior by Users will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is
      expected to comply immediately. If a User engages in unacceptable behavior, the Block CTF organizers
      may take any action they deem appropriate at their sole discretion, up to and including expulsion from
      the Competition and expulsion from the BlockCTF Discord.
    </p>

    <h2>Reporting Guide</h2>
    <p>
      If you are being subjected to unacceptable behavior on this platform (i.e. the Competition or the BlockCTF
      Discord), notice that someone else is being subjected to unacceptable behavior, or have concerns that this Code of
      Conduct is not being followed, notify a Block CTF Organizer as soon as possible, either by contacting them in
      the BlockCTF Discord, or by emailing <b>ctf-help@squareup.com</b>.
    </p>
    <p>In your report, please include:
      <ul>
        <li>Your contact information.</li>
        <li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses,
          please include them as well.</li>
        <li>Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
          available record please include a link.</li>
        <li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>After filing a report, a Block CTF Organizer will contact you personally. The Block CTF Organizers will then
      review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. All
      reports will remain as confidential as possible. The Block CTF Organizers will determine and carry out the
      appropriate course of action, and will be available to help Users experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe
      for the duration of the Competition.
