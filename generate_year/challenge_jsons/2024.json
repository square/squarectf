      "description": "A high-security server, **SecureVault Inc.**, uses RSA encryption to protect sensitive data. The server utilizes a **1024-bit RSA key** and employs the **CRT optimization** during decryption to improve performance.\n\nDue to a hardware fault, the server occasionally introduces errors during the decryption process. Specifically, the fault affects the computation of m_p = c^{d_p} mod p during the CRT step, causing  m_p to be incorrect, while m_q = c^{d_q} mod q remains correct.\n\nAs an experienced cryptanalyst, you have managed to obtain access to the server's decryption service. Your goal is to exploit the faulty decryption results to recover the prime factors  p and q of the RSA modulus n, effectively breaking the encryption scheme and recovering the private key.\n\nnc 54.85.45.101 8010",
